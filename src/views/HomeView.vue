          The radiant goddess Circe sent a sail filling wind behind us, a good
          companion for a voyage. We made all shipshape aboard and sat tight:
          wind and helmsman kept her on her course. All day long we ran before
          the wind, with never a quiver on the sail; then the sun set, and all
          the ways grew dark.
